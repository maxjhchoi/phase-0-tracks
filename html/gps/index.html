<!-- 
What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
HTML5 semantic tags are used to classify certain element(s) so that they can be referenced and given formatting, attriubutes, etc. I find main to be the most useful as it represents the meat of the website.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
The browser displays elements from top to bottom of the source code.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
I learned about how to use snippets, which are basically shortcuts. As I start coding more, I can imagine creating snippets for code blocks that I use the most often.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept? 
The most challenging concept was making correct use of the semantic tags. I need to have someone with experience to validate my code to ensure I'm not making mistakes.
