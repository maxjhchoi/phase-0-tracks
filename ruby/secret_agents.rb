#Encrypt Formula

def encrypt(userPassword)
  index = 0
  #counter set at zero
  encryptedArray = []
  #empty array to hold processed password
  while index < userPassword.length
    #loop repeats for each character in password
    if userPassword[index] == "z"
      #condition to correct z error
      encryptedArray << "a"
      #places the 'a' in the array
    else
      encryptedArray << userPassword[index].next
      #places the next letter in the alphabet (for a given character) in array
    end
    #ends 'if' loop
    index += 1
    #starts counting so loop isn't infinite
  end
  #ends 'while' loop
  p "#{encryptedArray.join}"
  #prints result '.join' used to put into a word
end
#end of Encrypt Formula

#Decrypt Formula

def decrypt(userPassword)
  index = 0
  #counter set at 0
  decryptedArray = []
  #empty array to hold processed password
  alphabet = ('a'..'z').to_a.join
  #creates single word string of the alphabet
  until index == userPassword.length
    #loop repeats until it is same length as input
    letterIndex = alphabet.index(userPassword[index])
    #finding letter index in alphabet
    prevLetter = letterIndex - 1
    #identifies letter before
    decryptedArray << alphabet[prevLetter]
    #places previous letter in the alphabet (for a given character) in array
    index += 1
    #starts counting so loop isn't infinite
  end
  #ends 'until' loop'
  p "#{decryptedArray.join}"
end
#end of Decrypt Formula

#encrypt("abc")
#encrypt("zed")
#decrypt("bcd")
#decrypt("afe")

#decrypt(encrypt("swordfish")) this works because the parenthesis guides the order of the operation. The encrypt method is run first, then the output of that goes through the decrypt method.
