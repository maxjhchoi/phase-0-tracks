# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
	* Version control is a process to manage changes to a file. It is useful because it can help keep track of changes that are made, especially when working in a team of more than one person, and offers the utility of reverting back to previous versions.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	* A branch is essentially a new user story where one can make changes to a document without those changes immediately being reflected to the master file. This is useful not only from a version control perspective, but also because it helps to break a project down into multiple components, each of which a different person can work on and later merge into the master file. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	* A commit is a save point for changes made. A good commit message is a clear and meticulous description of the changes that were made for other people working on the same project (or for your own future reference). 
	
* What is a merge conflict?
	* A merge conflict is an error that may happen when integrating a branch into another branch or master file.
